Abbreviation Definition Recognition Software

The ExtractAbbrev class implements a simple algorithm for extraction of
abbreviations and their definitions from biomedical text. Abbreviations (short
forms) are extracted from the input file, and those abbreviations for which a
definition (long form) is found are printed out, along with that definition,
one per line. A file consisting of short-form/long-form pairs (tab separated)
can be specified in tandem with the -testlist option for the purposes of
evaluating the algorithm.
