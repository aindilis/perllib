<div class="ultimatesbplugin_top"> <script type="text/javascript">digg_url = 'http://www.frdcsa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:motivation-for-software-conglomeration&amp;catid=34:old-writings-on-ai&amp;Itemid=37'; digg_title = 'Motivation for Our Programme of Software Conglomeration'; digg_bodytext = ''; digg_bgcolor = '#ffffff'; digg_window = 'new';</script><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"></script><br/> </div>Let us give a rough outline of the logic behind this decision.<br /><br />First is that one must have a vision, that is an understanding of a goal, such as artificial intelligence.<br /><br />In my case, I could clearly see situations, usually social, in which I could imagine a computer performing a very complex set of tasks to arrive at some socially productive answers.<br /><br />Unlike people untrained in computers and logic, I could not specifically disprove that a computer could do this. Besides, the risk of failure to achieve this goal is very large. &lt;&lt;&lt;opportunity cost&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />So I began to try to create a system. Like many who first start out, I fell into basic traps. I thought that I could write metaprograms, programs that wrote other programs which were more capable than themselves. Of course this ignores fundamental computer science concepts. It is based off practical work with computers, not theoretical. Of course, the lisp language is specifically crafted for this kind of metaprogramming, and it is a very basic possibility for automata to rewrite themselves, so like most beginner AI ideas they are hardly novel. So the idea is actually quite good, but it is not complete, it is only a fragment. It is necessary, but not sufficient.<br /><br />In fact, most beginner AI ideas sound quite fuuny to people who know what has been developed. A beginner AI researcher will come along and say - we can have programs that map out all the words that people use and make a meaning for it (a dictionary?). Or maybe a more advanced suggestion - we could have mysql databases of available software - with all the dependencies recorded (apt-get?). So it is really quite funny listening to someone say basically - we could have round things that we could roll around on, as if the idea were new.<br /><br />There are many other basic traps that I fell into. Another interesting one involved trying to model systems from data. I thought that I could have a system that observed interactions and "abducted" models of them. Well, this is quite true and there are many good uses of this, what is called model-checking (although model checking usually works from specifications and not observations). But ultimately, what was most damaging was that I had completely ignored the issue of what I would make my models out of. I thought programs, and this is fine, but really what is necessary is the notion of an object language to be learned. Of course, since these ideas are not well defined, there are many related concepts which are categorized by them. It covers quite a broad range.<br /><br />So, the high point of my research came when I studied existing research extensively, which I had previously tried not to do for fear of confirmation bias. I am happy to say that I do not feel that I have been biased (any more than necessary) by my studies, but only that I came across results which tended to make my own notions more rigorous.<br /><br />Also, during this period of intense study, where I would attend graduate classes from 8 in the morning until 6 at night, and then read at night, I was really fulfilling my neurological needs as an Asperger. Although I didn't know it at the time, my obsessive need to collect every fact, which is similar to my obsessive need to look at every possible move on a chess board, was really a fulfillment of my needs.<br /><br />I made a few assumptions about my work on AI. First, without actually learning of the distinction between strong AI and weak AI, I realized that there were indeed two classes of AI, and that weak AI seems a prerequisite of strong AI. In fact I was relatively certain because strong AI would be capable of achieving weak AI on its own. So either way, weak AI would be developed.<br /><br />Weak AI means to me problems that are solved by existing mathematical and computational technologies - that is, all problems that are computable by classical computers.<br /><br />This begs this question, "what is the class of problems that computer can solve", and also this, "can they solve all formalizable problems about their own behaviour". In fact, my initial work centered on finding this program, but I did not know how complex this program would be.<br /><br />What tended to startle people in the earlier part of last century was that this program did not in fact exist. It had been called by various names in the past - the Entscheidungsproblem, the Hilbert program. Several people simultaneously realized that this program did not exist. This included Church, Turing, Godel, Zermelo, Russell, King, Wittenstein, (even Socrates). Even Von Neumann was startled at this fact, which, in retrospect, is entirely obvious.<br /><br />But this fact is not at all a "negative" result as people seem to claim. Indeed this fact presents the solution to us very clearly.<br /><br />That is, for any program, there exists another program which is larger and which can solve a strictly larger class of problems.<br /><br />So, based on this relatively simple analysis, I compared the efficiency of these ideas. Since it is known that the time complexity of solving problems, as well as the extent of computable problems, is strictly increased with certain additions to program length, it was rather obvious which additions would provide the greatest increases. These would be the software systems with the greatest capacity relative to other systems. They would not be systems that I wrote myself, but would be systems that other people, scores of other people, had written with lots of funding.<br /><br />That is, our operative thesis is that the systems capabilities are increased the most by collecting the best software that others have written. Since we do not know, ahead of time, which software is most useful, we collect all of it, and apply decision methods and ratings and tests to all software, and package applications ordered by ease of packaging and utility after being packaged.<br /><br />Many people have problems with the fact that we do not uniquely specify which problem we intend to solve. This is a characteristic requirement which Asperger's do not have. The fact is that we have proven the systems capabilities have increased. Furthermore, we simply make the claim that we can, transitively, solve every problem which the system we collected was designed to solve.<br /><br />But in practice there are very few attempts at collecting software. The reason for this is most people are motivated to solve a specific goal. But solving a particular problem is usually a waste of time. It forces a long and complicated search (naturally because the system is weaker proof theoretically than a larger system). Collecting software on the otherhand, in leiu of automatically solving more problems later, is very important. But in order to solve more problems, a certain minimal rate is needed to have a self sustaining reaction.<br /><br />That is why I implore you to help me find people willing to program packages for an indefinite period of time.<br /><br />The cost of failure are infinite stacks, and we have proposed a most reasonable objective. Furthermore, the lack of such similar practices indicates a certain novelty, which may be attached to the probably of finding a gifted Asperger.<br /><br />Of course, there is a limit to how much software we can collect. But we are far from that limit - and once we hit it, our situation will be quite different. We will have shared systems that are in many respects extremely capable. Until we collect this software, we realize, like Godel's S and S', that there are infinitely classes of theorems that we cannot prove with our systems.<br /><br />Einstein, Godel, Newton - all the greats had Asperger's. It is ironic and unfortunate that by virtue of the very skills I have, and the skills I apparently don't have, the skills I have are ridiculed, and the skills I don't have are taken as an excuse to not send me to a school where I belong. Everything we see is a product of this misappropriation of talent. In highschool I worked at Fermilab as an experimental physicist, with a classmate. She went to Princeton as a physicist. But everyone thought I was lazy, because people didn't realize that my lack of executive skills, such as time management, allowed me to see things that other people don't. Now, daily my work, which is clearly of historical importance, is forsaken by those who claim to love me. Let actions speak louder than words. Let the truth out. Please stop murdering the truth. You are risking the entire stability of reality.<br /><br />If somebody writes a 30 million dollar program and gives it away for free, and you don't have it, your genetic material will spontaneously mutate into that of an ameoba. That's like rejecting someone's offer to give you a space shuttle, on the grounds that you can't imagine why in the world you would need it. Moreover if you repeat this 5000 times, you are in trouble. No, I agree with your assessment, why not write it yourself? After all, there's nothing that 1000000 postdoctorate genius programmers could do in thirty years that you couldn't do in a week with C++, right?<br /></td>

This principle is stated to identify the naive tendency to complexify through nonstandard additions to a system. The result is a nonstandard system which cannot be easily recreated, which slighty increases the complexity at a cost of great disorder. We are looking for highly complex, highly ordered systems.<br /><br />The advocated method is to cleanly identify a system and package it in a generic way. That is, to make additions to the set of applications not modifications to the operating system.<br /><br />The value of this method is that we can therefore keep things very clean, that we conform to de facto et jour standards (ok, ok, de facto and de jour), that interfaces are implemented wholly and cleanly. There are other important properties of a system in addition to complexity, such as completeness, soundness, consistency, etc.<br /><br />So, imagine that we suppose a measure of a certain property, such as soundness. Let us further imagine that the range is a lattice wrt the ordering of cleanliness</td>

If you make that assumption about me, that's like hearing that someone is a religious person and then chastising them for believing in Buddha (when in fact they might be Christian). There are many aspects to the field of AI. Probably the best way for you to think of this is that I work on IA, or intelligent agents. These are programs which are capable of solving problems that are considered useful by people.<br /><br />AI concerns itself with minimizing unnecessary psychological suffering due to avoidable accidents. We use techniques from logic, the same techniques that, for instance, make optimal chess playing programs, etc, and treat the world as a game and try to win the game, by mathematical optimizations and proofs that bad things don't happen. You can do this, you can make certain guarantees that certain failures don't happen for reasons that you are in control of - of course no one can yet control certain things, but at least you do the best you know how to do with what you have all the time. For instance, you won't make bad moves at chess, you won't not know the definition of a certain word, etc.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks AI is about taking control away from people doesn't really realize that a person and an AI together are still going to face difficult problems, it will make us better able to avoid certain common, unnecessary mistakes, and to help us mount higher challenges by providing rigour in situations where it wasn't previously available. It will not make us lazier, it will in fact make us harder working because we won't be burned and worn out and feel helpless towards mistakes we know ought not happen.<br /><br />People are good at learning complex systems but sacrifice perfect memory in exchange for other skills suited to learning complex systems, but some problems require specialized solutions, and this solution is the computer.<br /><br />We can look at a world with AI in the same way we look at the current world, and we can introduce AI in a way such that no requirements any person may have are rendered invalid by the AI. That is the goal, actually, to satisfy everyone's requirements. We model requirements in the usual logical way.<br /><br />A requirement is something that a person could express in English, and is represented by association to the intended semantics of the statement (as opposed to misreads of the requirement). The goal then is for the system to make as many of these requirements simulataneously true based on its laws (the requirements of all people) and its algorithm.<br /><br />algorithm n : a precise rule (or set of rules) specifying how to solve some problem [syn: {algorithmic rule}, {algorithmic program}]<br /><br />When I say that AI solves problems, it is in the sense of problems of logic. However, many real world problems may be solved by reducing them to problems of logic and the interpretting the solution.<br /><br />Let me describe to you in perhaps the clearest way possible the goal of what I work on.<br /><br />I realize that EVERY FAILED DEDUCTION LEADS TO FUTURE ACCIDENTS.<br /><br />Let me describe an accident. This is by no means pleasant. So if the accident I am about to describe were avoidable, it would make the world more pleasant.<br /><br />This accident involves a young boy being hit by a train. I know that what I work on would be capable of preventing his death and the consequent psychological suffering of all that knew him.<br /><br />While we cannot protect one hundred percent of people against one hundred percent of the hazards and vissicitudes of life, we can make relative improvements. We can in a formal sense make 100% safety in restricted systems, and of course the goal is to grow that safety to larger and larger systems. It is exactly the consistency of computers, which don't make them rigid thinkers, but which make them conditional and highly reliable system, that allows computers to solve with 100% completeness subclasses of existing problems. That is, prevent whole categories of accidents.<br /><br />The accident involving the boy follows a template that I have seen multiple times in videos of accidents, and even experienced myself. In a different video, the exact same failure situation leads to the death of a gazelle.<br /><br />This failure situation is one that I am aware now and which to some extent motivates unswerving commitment to the completion of my task.<br /><br />Since it will be easier to describe the gazelle scenario, I will start with that. The typical feature is that it is two animals, two deer in this case, and a threat which is perceived by one of the animals, which steps clear without thinking to alert the other. In this case, the deer are drinking from a water hole. The first deer is blocking the view of the second deer of the water hole. The first deer sees something approaching at it (an alligator), and quietly turns around and leaves the water. From the point of view of the second dear, the movement of the first deer conceals the movement of the alligator, which proceeds to jump up and trap and kill the second deer.<br /><br />I am very offended by the existence of such scenarios in nature. I think they should be stopped. I understand methods that would prevent this and a great many other classes of accidents.<br /><br />Now we will describe the death of the boy, which parallels closely the death of the deer. Two young boys are walking towards a train track. There is a stationary train on the track which conceals an oncoming train. A train horn is blowing, and the boys fatally presume it is the stationary train. From the point of view of the camera, as the boys near the tracks we see that the second train moving at about 80 MPH is the real source of the horn sound. The boys are walking side by side, let us call the first boy the boy who is closer to the train. The first boy blocks the view of the second boy. When the train is now within about 80 feet the first boy perceives it and stops on the very edge of track. He turns around and steps back automatically (clearly is not thinking at all about the second boy), barely missing the train. The second boy is now about 4 feet in front of the first boy, and his head may be seen to hesitate for about a 6th of second, an short moment of psychological confusion before his hopelessly lost position is impacted by the approaching train. Needless to say the child's body is instantly accelerated and rockets about three hundred feet in a second actually hitting the cameraman at a velocity of roughly 75 MPH.<br /><br />This death may have been prevented as a matter of logical completeness. All that is needing is a facility to alert the child to avoid that position. A deduction was necessary which would have triggered a communication that the child should stop, we in advance of the precipitious accident. I understand how to implement this, and how to set up the correspondances between the mind and the system.<br /><br />It is in this spirit that I pursue the development of AI, a system which I know can prevent large classes of accidents. It is sufficient to prevent an accident to have a proof that it will not happen. Here we take proof in the formal mathematical sense. By establishing correspondances between the physical world and the simulated computer world, simulation occuring with knowledge based systems, etc, (which is more akin to a very precise, somewhat accurate human mental model than to say a simple physics simulation), correspondences that take place through input output devices like mind to machine interfaces, cameras, etc., we will be able to eliminate large ammounts of psychological suffering as the result of accidents that are preventable by these systems.<br /><br />To give a simple account of a simple implementation, suppose that we have image understanding routines. &lt;Show video of VSAM&gt; The camera agent, an IA (intelligent agent) with image understanding intelligent software, would be creating and forwarding live information to an AI, perhaps in the camera, perhaps at a nearby station, across a wireless adhoc network, etc. The information would be complex, but in the spirit of the existing technology, would look about equal to a length novel worth of statements of the following form.<br /><br />(#$approaching #$OurPoorFriendForWhomWeGrieve #$railtrack-39423) (#$approaching #$OurUnfortunateSurvivor #$railtrack-39423) (#$emittingSound #$train-32488)<br /><br />Of course, there would be optimizations, etc, such as dialogs between the camera and the IA.<br /><br />Now, when the camera reports the approaching train (or even before, there might be a system which is devoted to general purpose collision avoidance, which has already contacted the IA with information of the approaching train), the IA makes the inference that there is<br /><br />(#$likelyEvent (#$and (#$dies OurPoorFriendForWhomWeGrieve) (#$collisionWith #$train-32488)))<br /><br />I.E. It is able to prove this. &lt;Show cyc knowledge base&gt;. In which case the IA contacts the agent present with the child. The agent advises the child to stop, 100 feet in advance of the approaching train. This child, if contacted in advance, would not have died.<br /><br />Here we have shown how this child's death may have been prevented using existing technology. Now, people might make the claim that this is a pathological singular point and that in reality we cannot prevent such things in all cases. Their argument is overly general and, for what?! The fact is that it is both obviously highly important to protect people from accidents, and it is also not a singular point, it is the rigour and completeness of the search procedures of logic that make this possible, and it does not rely on serendipity. It cannot prove everything, but it could have saved the lives of everyone I have personally known who has died, and it can do much more than that.<br /><br />I am motivated on account of the horrible experience of the similar way in which my beloved sister died and an intuitive understanding of the underlying technology to pursue without hesitation or disruption the development of this technology, and I sincerely hope that people will join me in this effort. (Cruelly, she alone would have supported my work unconditionally.) I have obtained what I feel is the main necessary result, that we may consider for the purposes of our system the world as a large set of problems, which need to be decided, but for any program offered as a solution, there are always much larger fragments of the problems that are not solvable by that program. Therefore I believe it to be the case that by collecting and distributing complex and intelligent software via the Debian GNU/Linux system, we will be rapidly reducing the number of unsolvable problems of logic, which when they remain unsolved, are exactly the cause of every accident in the world and a majority of psychological suffering.<br /></td>
