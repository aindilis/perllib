    There  seems to  be,  amazingly enough,  various standard  library
    features that are absent within CPAN.  PerlLib is therefore simply
    a  collection of  miscellaneous  modules developed  for our  other
    systems that really belong in  an API.  This may eventually relate
    to   the  shared   standard  programming   library,  which   is  a
    semi-automatically  generated  library of  an  enormous number  of
    standard algorithms with a knowledge base and expert systems.
