package Capability::Roundtrip;

# enable software to keep multiple items synced despite their formats.

# e.g. suppose you have something like Alexa's shopping list and todo
# list.  We can't easily work with it since it's under their control,
# but we can't sync it with our local copy and try to ensure that
# operations done on one version are Roundtripped over to the other.
# Maybe sync is better than roundtrip, have to look up exactly.
